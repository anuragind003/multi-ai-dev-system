Okay, I'm ready to generate the migration files based on your specifications. Please provide the following information:

*   **{db\_type}**: The type of database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
*   **{migration\_tool}**: The migration tool you're using (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, Django migrations, Rails migrations, Alembic).
*   **{migration\_format}**: The desired format for the migration files (e.g., SQL, Python, Ruby).
*   **{schema}**: The database schema definition. This is the most crucial part.  Provide the table definitions, data types, relationships (foreign keys), and any constraints.
*   **{rag\_context}**:  Any additional context or instructions. This could include:
    *   Specific seed data requirements.
    *   Naming conventions for tables or columns.
    *   Any existing data that needs to be considered during the migration.
    *   Any specific performance considerations.

Once you provide this information, I will generate the migration files according to your requirements. I will provide the filename and the code for each migration file.
