# General Backend Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions on how to deploy the General backend in a production environment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes (optional)
- Helm (optional)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build Docker Image**:
   - Run `docker build -t general-backend .` to build the Docker image.

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Run `docker-compose up` to start the backend and its dependencies (database) locally.

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   - Apply the Kubernetes manifests in the `infrastructure/k8s` directory to deploy the backend to a Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - The Prometheus configuration is included in the `infrastructure/monitoring` directory. You can use it to monitor the backend and its components.

## Scaling

- To scale the backend horizontally, you can increase the number of replicas in the Kubernetes deployment manifest.
- For database scaling, you can use a managed database service or set up a database cluster.

## Security

- The backend includes built-in security middleware and authentication mechanisms.
- Make sure to configure the secret key and other security-related settings appropriately.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during deployment, please check the logs and the documentation for common problems and solutions.
