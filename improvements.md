# Future Improvements & Enhancement Plan

This document outlines a roadmap for significant enhancements to the Multi-AI Development System. The improvements are categorized into backend and frontend workstreams, focusing on increasing efficiency, autonomy, and user experience.

## Backend Improvements

The goal for the backend is to move towards a more robust, efficient, and truly autonomous system.

### 1. Evolve to a "Virtual Software Development Team" Model (Completed)

- **Status:** Done.
- **Completed Work:**
  - **Architect Agent:** A series of agents now handle BRD Analysis, Tech Stack, System Design, and Planning, with human approval gates at each step.
  - **Specialist Developer Agents (TDD):** The development workflow now iterates through a backlog of work items. For each item, a specialist agent generates both the implementation code and corresponding unit tests.
  - **Automated QA Agent & Self-Correction:** A two-stage validation process is now in place. A `CodeQualityAgent` performs static analysis, and then a `test_execution_node` runs the generated unit tests. Failures in either stage trigger a revision loop.
  - **Integration Agent:** After a work item's unit tests pass, a new `integration_node` merges the code into the main project and runs a full suite of integration tests to ensure no regressions were introduced. This completes the CI/CD-like pipeline.
- **Next Steps:** This phase is complete. The next logical step is to focus on enhancing the individual agents' capabilities or moving to other items on the roadmap.

### 2. Full Project Context Awareness & Self-Healing (Completed)

- **Status:** Done.
- **Completed Work:**
  - **RAG Manager:** A new `RAGManager` was created. It's responsible for scanning the entire project directory, indexing all source code files, and creating a searchable vector store. This manager is initialized for each session, providing a fresh index of the current project state.
  - **Agent Integration:** The `BaseAgent` was enhanced with a `_get_rag_context` method, allowing any specialist agent to easily query the codebase.
  - **Context-Aware Generation:** The core specialist agents (`CoreBackendAgent`, `FrontendGeneratorAgent`, `DatabaseGeneratorAgent`, `CodeOptimizerAgent`) have been updated. Before generating or modifying code, they now retrieve relevant snippets from the existing codebase to ensure context preservation, consistency, and better integration.
- **Next Steps:** This phase is complete. The agents are now significantly more intelligent and capable of producing code that aligns with the existing project.

### 3. Deepen Asynchronous Integration (Partially Done)

- **Current State:** The overall workflow runs asynchronously (`async_graph.py`), and synchronous agent functions are wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` for compatibility. This prevents the event loop from being blocked but does not represent true, deep asynchronicity.
- **Improvement:** Refactor the `run` methods within the core agents (`BaseAgent` subclasses) to be `async def`. This would involve using the `ainvoke` methods on the underlying LLM chains.
- **Benefit:** True asynchronicity will increase server throughput, allowing the application to handle more concurrent workflow sessions with fewer resources and improved responsiveness.

### 4. Standardize the Human Approval Data Contract (completed)

- **Current State:** The data payload sent to the frontend for human approval is constructed on-the-fly within `app/server.py`. This creates a brittle coupling between the backend's internal state and the frontend's UI components.
- **Improvement:** Define a strict Pydantic model for the `HumanApprovalPayload`. The backend's responsibility would be to populate this model correctly for each approval stage.
- **Benefit:** This decouples the backend from the frontend, reduces the likelihood of UI bugs when the state changes, makes the API contract explicit, and simplifies the process of adding new approval steps.

## Frontend Improvements

The goal for the frontend is to evolve it from a simple monitoring tool into a rich, interactive development environment.

### 1. From Log Viewer to Interactive Dashboard

- **Current State:** The UI primarily functions as a real-time log viewer, presenting the results of each stage as formatted JSON or simple lists.
- **Improvement:** Develop rich, interactive components for visualizing key outputs:
  - **System Design:** Render an interactive flowchart (e.g., using `Mermaid.js`) showing components, relationships, and data flows.
  - **Implementation Plan:** Display the plan as a dynamic Gantt chart or an interactive timeline.
- **Benefit:** This will provide a more professional and intuitive user experience, allowing for a much clearer understanding of the AI's complex outputs.

### 2. Integrated Code Viewer and Editor(going on)

- **Current State:** The generated codebase is not visible within the application. The user has to check the file system manually.
- **Improvement:** Integrate a file tree component that displays the generated project structure from the `output` directory. Clicking a file should open it in a read-only code editor component (e.g., Monaco Editor).
- **Benefit:** This is a critical usability enhancement. It transforms the tool into a web-based IDE, allowing the user to directly review the AI's work in a familiar environment.

### 3. Contextual Feedback and Revisions

- **Current State:** The "Request Revision" feature uses a single, global text box for feedback, which is not tied to any specific part of the output.
- **Improvement:** Allow for inline comments and feedback. For example, a user could highlight a specific requirement in the BRD analysis or a component in the system design diagram and add a targeted comment.
- **Benefit:** This will lead to much more precise and effective revisions, as the AI will receive structured, contextual feedback on exactly what needs to change.

### 4. "Autonomous Mode" Toggle

- **Current State:** The workflow now requires manual approval at every major gate, which is great for control but removes the original "fire-and-forget" capability.
- **Improvement:** Add a simple "Autonomous Mode" toggle to the UI. When enabled, the frontend would automatically submit a "proceed" decision for each human approval gate.
- **Benefit:** This gives the user the best of both worlds: fine-grained control when they need it, and hands-off automation when they trust the process for a given task.
