# Simple CRUD API for Products

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple RESTful API to manage product information. The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete product entries.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **FR1: Create Product:**
  - Users must be able to add a new product to the system.
  - A product must have a `name` (string), `description` (string, optional), `price` (float), and `stock_quantity` (integer).
  - A unique ID should be automatically generated for each product.
- **FR2: Get All Products:**
  - Users must be able to retrieve a list of all products.
  - The list should include all product details (ID, name, description, price, stock_quantity).
- **FR3: Get Product by ID:**
  - Users must be able to retrieve details for a specific product using its unique ID.
- **FR4: Update Product:**
  - Users must be able to modify an existing product's details (name, description, price, stock_quantity) using its ID.
  - Partial updates (e.g., updating only the price) should be supported.
- **FR5: Delete Product:**
  - Users must be able to remove a product from the system using its ID.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1: Performance:** API responses should be fast, ideally within 200ms for common operations.
- **NFR2: Scalability:** The system should be able to handle up to 100 concurrent requests.
- **NFR3: Simplicity:** The chosen technology stack should prioritize ease of development and deployment for this initial version.
- **NFR4: Data Persistence:** Product data must be stored persistently.

## 4. Assumptions

- No user authentication/authorization is required for this initial version.
- Error handling should be basic (e.g., return 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).
- The API will be deployed on a single server.
