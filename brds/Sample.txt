Project Title: Simple Task Tracker
Version: 0.5 (Beginner Draft)
Date: October 27, 2023
Author: AI BRD Assistant
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
The "Simple Task Tracker" is a web-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. It will allow users to create, view, update, and mark tasks as complete. The primary goal is to provide a straightforward and easy-to-use tool for personal task management.
1.2 Business Problem/Opportunity
Many individuals struggle to keep track of their personal to-do lists, leading to forgotten tasks and reduced productivity. While complex task management tools exist, some users prefer a very simple, no-frills solution. This project aims to fill that niche by offering a minimal and intuitive task tracking experience.
1.3 Project Goals & Objectives
Goal 1: Provide a simple way for users to manage their personal tasks.
Objective 1.1: Users can create a new task with a description and due date within 30 seconds.
Objective 1.2: Users can view all their pending tasks in a clear list.
Goal 2: Ensure the application is extremely easy to learn and use.
Objective 2.1: A new user can understand and use all core features within 5 minutes without instructions.
1.4 Scope
In-Scope:
User account creation and login (basic email/password).
Create a new task (with a title/description and an optional due date).
View a list of all tasks.
Mark tasks as "complete" or "incomplete."
Edit existing task descriptions and due dates.
Delete tasks.
Basic filtering of tasks (e.g., view only completed, view only pending).
Out-of-Scope:
Collaboration features (sharing tasks with others).
Task prioritization (e.g., high, medium, low).
Sub-tasks.
Reminders or notifications.
File attachments to tasks.
Mobile-specific applications (web application will be primary).
Advanced reporting or analytics.
Integration with calendars or other services.
1.5 Key Stakeholders
User: Individual seeking a simple task management tool.
Developer(s): The team building the application.
(Potentially) Product Owner: Person guiding the project vision (if part of a learning exercise).
1.6 Assumptions & Constraints
Assumptions:
Users have access to a web browser.
Users understand basic web application interactions.
Constraints:
The application should be developed using beginner-friendly technologies.
Focus on core functionality over extensive features.
No external API integrations required for MVP.
1.7 Success Metrics
Number of registered users after 1 month (e.g., 50 users).
Average number of tasks created per active user per week (e.g., 5 tasks).
User survey feedback indicating ease of use.
2. Proposed Solution
2.1 Solution Overview
A web application where users can log in to manage a personal list of tasks. The interface will be clean and minimalist, focusing on the essential actions of adding, viewing, editing, and completing tasks.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Accounts
* FR3.1.1: Users shall be able to create a new account using an email address and password.
* FR3.1.2: Users shall be able to log in with their registered email and password.
* FR3.1.3: The system shall securely store user passwords (e.g., hashed).
* FR3.1.4: Users shall be able to log out of their account.
3.2 Task Management
* FR3.2.1: Authenticated users shall be able to create a new task.
* A task must have a title/description (text input).
* A task can optionally have a due date (date picker).
* FR3.2.2: Users shall be able to view a list of all their tasks.
* Each task in the list should display its title, status (pending/complete), and due date (if set).
* FR3.2.3: Users shall be able to mark a task as "complete."
* FR3.2.4: Users shall be able to mark a "complete" task back to "incomplete" (pending).
* FR3.2.5: Users shall be able to edit the title/description and due date of an existing task.
* FR3.2.6: Users shall be able to delete a task. A confirmation should be requested before deletion.
3.3 Task Viewing & Filtering
* FR3.3.1: By default, the task list should show pending tasks first, possibly sorted by due date (earliest first).
* FR3.3.2: Users shall be able to filter the task list to show:
* All tasks
* Only pending tasks
* Only completed tasks
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Usability
* NFR4.1.1: The application interface must be simple, clean, and intuitive.
* NFR4.1.2: Core actions (add task, complete task) should be easily accessible.
4.2 Performance
* NFR4.2.1: The task list should load in under 3 seconds for up to 100 tasks.
* NFR4.2.2: Actions like creating or updating a task should complete in under 2 seconds.
4.3 Security
* NFR4.3.1: User passwords must be stored securely (hashed, not plain text).
* NFR4.3.2: Users should only be able to see and manage their own tasks.
* NFR4.3.3: Basic protection against common web vulnerabilities (like XSS on task descriptions) should be considered.
4.4 Reliability
* NFR4.4.1: The application should reliably save and retrieve task data.
5. Data Requirements
5.1 Key Data Entities
* User: (UserID, Email, PasswordHash)
* Task: (TaskID, UserID (foreign key to User), Title, Description, DueDate, IsCompleted (boolean), CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)
6. User Roles & Permissions
Authenticated User:
Can perform all actions defined in Functional Requirements (create, view, edit, delete, complete their own tasks).
(Sections like Integration, Reporting, Advanced Deployment are omitted for simplicity in a beginner BRD)
7. Glossary
Task: An item on the user's to-do list.
Pending Task: A task that has not yet been marked as complete.
Completed Task: A task that has been marked as done.
MVP: Minimum Viable Product.
