Version: 1.0

Date: May 27, 2025

Prepared By: ML.NET Team

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this Document
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) based system that can extract and identify key data points from various Indian identity documents (Aadhar Card, Driving License, Passport, Voter ID, PAN Card, Ration Card) and bank passbooks. The extracted data will be categorized, stored, and made accessible as variables for further processing. This document will serve as a guiding resource for the development team, ensuring alignment with business objectives.

1.2 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to develop an automated solution that:

Receives image inputs of specified documents.
Identifies the type of document from the image.
Performs OCR to extract text from the identified document.
Parses and categorizes the extracted text into predefined data fields (e.g., Name, Date of Birth, Address, Document Number).
Stores the extracted and categorized data in a structured format.
Provides the extracted data as accessible variables.
1.3 Business Need
Currently, the process of extracting information from identity documents and bank passbooks is manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This often leads to delays in onboarding processes, data entry inaccuracies, and increased operational costs. An automated OCR-based system is needed to:

Improve data accuracy and reduce errors.
Expedite data capture and processing.
Enhance operational efficiency.
Reduce manual effort and associated costs.
Ensure compliance by accurately capturing required information.
1.4 Target Audience
This document is intended for:

Business Stakeholders
Project Managers
Development Team
Quality Assurance Team
Solution Architects
2. Business Goals and Objectives
2.1 Business Goals
Automate data extraction from key identity documents and bank passbooks.
Achieve a high level of accuracy in data extraction.
Reduce manual data entry efforts by at least X% (e.g., 80%).
Decrease processing time for document verification by at least Y% (e.g., 70%).
2.2 Business Objectives
Develop an OCR system capable of identifying and processing at least 7 distinct document types (Aadhar, DL, Passport, Voter ID, PAN, Ration Card, Bank Passbook).
Achieve an average data extraction accuracy of 95% or higher for critical fields (Name, Document ID, DoB).
Ensure the extracted data can be stored in a structured, easily retrievable format.
Provide a mechanism to output extracted data as variables for integration with downstream systems.
Develop a user-friendly interface for image input and result display (if applicable for a specific phase).
3. Current State / As-Is Process (Optional, if a manual process exists)
Currently, the process involves:

Receiving physical or digital copies of documents.
Manually reviewing each document to identify its type.
Manually extracting relevant information from the document.
Manually entering the extracted data into a system/database.
Performing manual validation of the entered data.
4. Future State / To-Be Process
The future state process will involve:

Image Input: An image of an identity document or bank passbook is provided to the system.
Document Type Identification: The system automatically identifies the type of document (e.g., Aadhar Card, Driving License).
OCR Processing: OCR is performed on the identified document to extract all discernible text.
Data Extraction and Categorization: The system intelligently parses the extracted text and categorizes it into predefined fields (e.g., Name, Date of Birth, Address, Document Number, Father's Name, etc.).
Data Storage: The extracted and categorized data is stored in a structured format.
Variable Output: The extracted data is made available as variables for further system integration or display.
