    "raw_brd": "# Simple CRUD API for Products\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the requirements for a simple RESTful API to manage product information. The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete product entries.\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR1: Create Product:**\n  - Users must be able to add a new product to the system.\n  - A product must have a `name` (string), `description` (string, optional), `price` (float), and `stock_quantity` (integer).\n  - A unique ID should be automatically generated for each product.\n- **FR2: Get All Products:**\n  - Users must be able to retrieve a list of all products.\n  - The list should include all product details (ID, name, description, price, stock_quantity).\n- **FR3: Get Product by ID:**\n  - Users must be able to retrieve details for a specific product using its unique ID.\n- **FR4: Update Product:**\n  - Users must be able to modify an existing product's details (name, description, price, stock_quantity) using its ID.\n  - Partial updates (e.g., updating only the price) should be supported.\n- **FR5: Delete Product:**\n  - Users must be able to remove a product from the system using its ID.\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- **NFR1: Performance:** API responses should be fast, ideally within 200ms for common operations.\n- **NFR2: Scalability:** The system should be able to handle up to 100 concurrent requests.\n- **NFR3: Simplicity:** The chosen technology stack should prioritize ease of development and deployment for this initial version.\n- **NFR4: Data Persistence:** Product data must be stored persistently.\n\n## 4. Assumptions\n\n- No user authentication/authorization is required for this initial version.\n- Error handling should be basic (e.g., return 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).\n- The API will be deployed on a single server.\n",
