# Backup and Recovery Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for backing up critical data and recovering the FastAPI backend application in case of data loss or system failure.

## 1. Critical Data Identification

The primary critical data for this application is the **PostgreSQL database**. All application state and user data reside here.

## 2. Backup Strategy

### 2.1 Database Backups (PostgreSQL)

**Frequency:** Daily full backups, hourly differential backups (if applicable).
**Retention:** 7 days for daily, 4 weeks for weekly, 3 months for monthly.
**Location:** Encrypted object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).

#### 2.1.1 Automated Backups (Recommended for Production)

For Kubernetes deployments, consider using:
*   **Cloud Provider Managed Backups**: AWS RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL offer automated backups.
*   **Kubernetes Operators**: Tools like [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) or [Crunchy Data PostgreSQL Operator](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-kubernetes/) can manage database lifecycle, including backups.
*   **CronJobs with `pg_dump`**: A Kubernetes CronJob can execute `pg_dump` and upload the backup to object storage.
