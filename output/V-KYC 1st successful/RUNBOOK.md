## 1. Overview

This document describes the operational aspects of the FastAPI application, which serves as a RESTful API. It is containerized using Docker and deployed via Kubernetes (or Docker Compose for smaller scale).

*   **Application Name:** FastAPI_App
*   **Repository:** [Link to your GitHub Repository]
*   **Primary Language:** Python 3.11
*   **Framework:** FastAPI
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Deployment:** Kubernetes (production), Docker Compose (development/local production)
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## 2. Architecture

The application's production architecture typically includes:

*   **FastAPI Application:** Python application serving API endpoints.
*   **Docker:** Containerization for consistent environments.
*   **Nginx:** Reverse proxy for load balancing, SSL termination, and serving static files (if any).
*   **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration for scaling, self-healing, and deployment management.
*   **Prometheus:** For collecting metrics from the application and infrastructure.
*   **Grafana:** For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
*   **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
