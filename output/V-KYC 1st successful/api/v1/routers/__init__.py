# This file makes the 'routers' directory a Python package.
# It can also be used to import all routers for convenience in main.py,
# though explicit imports are often preferred for clarity.

# Example of explicit imports in main.py:
# from api.v1.routers import recordings, health

# If you wanted to auto-import all:
# from . import recordings, health
# __all__ = ["recordings", "health"]
