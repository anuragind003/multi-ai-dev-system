    "project_summary": "To develop a self-service portal/dashboard for V-KYC team leads to directly search, access, and download V-KYC video recordings for audit purposes. This will replace the current manual process of requesting recordings from the IT data server team.",
    "project_goals": [
      "To provide a self-service mechanism for fetching V-KYC recordings.",
      "To eliminate the dependency on the IT data server team for retrieving recordings.",

    "business_context": "Currently, the V-KYC team must submit a manual request to the IT data server team to obtain V-KYC recordings, which are stored on an LTF NFS (Network File System) server. This process is inefficient and creates delays, especially when recordings are needed for audit requirements. The project aims to create a dedicated portal to automate and simplify this retrieval process.",
