    "frontend": {
      "name": "React with TypeScript",
      "reasoning": "React is the optimal choice due to its vast ecosystem, component-based architecture, and strong community support. This is ideal for building the required interactive UI, including the data table with pagination/filtering (REQ-005, REQ-008), file upload component (REQ-006), and search functionality (REQ-004). Using TypeScript adds static typing, which is critical for reducing bugs and improving maintainability in an application handling sensitive audit data. The large talent pool for React ensures long-term support and ease of development."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven I/O model is perfectly suited for the project's core task: efficiently reading video files from an NFS server and streaming them to users for download (REQ-009, REQ-010). This directly addresses the performance risk associated with bulk downloads. Using JavaScript/TypeScript on the backend creates synergy with the React frontend, streamlining development. Express.js provides a minimalist and robust foundation for building the required API, with extensive middleware for handling file uploads, authentication, and security headers to protect sensitive data (REQ-002)."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "The project requires storing structured metadata (LAN, file path, date, etc.) and potentially audit logs of user activity. PostgreSQL's ACID compliance, reliability, and robust indexing capabilities make it the best choice for ensuring data integrity and fast query performance for searching by LAN and filtering by date (REQ-004, REQ-005). Its support for advanced data types and security features is essential for an application used for audit purposes."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS is the best choice because of its mature and comprehensive services for building a hybrid architecture. The application needs to connect to an on-premise NFS server. AWS provides robust and secure solutions for this, such as AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. The application can be hosted on Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate, with the database managed by Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, simplifying operations. Furthermore, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) offers granular control to meet the strict access restrictions for V-KYC leads (REQ-002)."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Monolithic Backend with Decoupled Frontend (2-Tier Architecture)",
      "reasoning": "A microservices architecture would be over-engineering for this project's well-defined and limited scope. A monolithic backend is simpler to develop, test, deploy, and maintain for a small team. It provides a single point for API logic, authentication, and interaction with the NFS and database. Decoupling the React frontend as a Single Page Application (SPA) creates a clean separation of concerns, allowing the frontend and backend to be developed and scaled independently while communicating over a well-defined API. This approach is the most pragmatic and cost-effective for the given requirements."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Containerizes the React frontend and Node.js backend, ensuring consistent development, testing, and production environments. This eliminates 'it works on my machine' issues and simplifies deployment to AWS."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git & GitHub",
        "reasoning": "Git is the standard for version control. GitHub provides a centralized repository for collaboration, code reviews, and issue tracking, which is essential for team-based development and maintaining code quality."
      },
      {
        "name": "GitHub Actions",
        "reasoning": "Provides an integrated CI/CD pipeline directly within the code repository. It can be configured to automatically run tests, build Docker images, and deploy the application to AWS upon code merges, ensuring a fast, reliable, and automated release process."

The core of the architecture leverages the I/O strengths of Node.js to efficiently serve video files from the existing on-premise NFS, mitigating the primary performance risk. A decoupled React frontend provides a modern and responsive user experience for the V-KYC team. PostgreSQL ensures the integrity of the metadata, which is critical for audit purposes. This entire application is deployed on AWS, utilizing its robust hybrid networking to securely connect to the on-premise data source and its mature IAM service to enforce strict access controls. The Monolithic architecture and the toolchain (Docker, Git, GitHub Actions) prioritize developer productivity and deployment simplicity, making it the most pragmatic and effective solution for this specific project.",
