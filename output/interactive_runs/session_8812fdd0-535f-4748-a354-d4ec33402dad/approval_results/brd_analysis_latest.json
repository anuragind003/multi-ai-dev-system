    "project_summary": "To develop a self-service portal/dashboard for the V-KYC team to search, view, and download V-KYC video recordings for internal and external audit purposes. This will replace the current manual process of requesting recordings from the IT data server team.",
    "project_goals": [
      "Eliminate the dependency on the IT data server team for retrieving V-KYC recordings.",
      "Provide V-KYC team leads with on-demand access to video recordings.",
