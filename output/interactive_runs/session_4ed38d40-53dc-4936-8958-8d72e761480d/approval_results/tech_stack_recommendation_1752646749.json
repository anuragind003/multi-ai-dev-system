    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React's component-based architecture facilitates building a modular and maintainable UI for the dashboard. Its virtual DOM optimizes rendering performance, crucial for displaying and handling potentially large datasets of V-KYC recordings. React's extensive ecosystem and community support provide ample resources and libraries for implementing features like data tables, file uploads, and search functionality. TypeScript integration can improve code quality and maintainability."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js, with Express.js, offers a lightweight and scalable backend solution. Its non-blocking I/O model is well-suited for handling asynchronous operations like fetching video recordings from the NFS server and processing file uploads. JavaScript on both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) simplifies development and allows for code reuse. The vast npm ecosystem provides numerous libraries for tasks such as API development, file processing, and database interaction. The ability to easily create RESTful APIs is essential for the frontend to communicate with the backend."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that provides excellent data integrity and ACID compliance. It's well-suited for storing metadata about the V-KYC recordings (e.g., LAN ID, date, file path). PostgreSQL's support for JSON data types allows for flexible storage of additional metadata. Its advanced indexing capabilities enable efficient searching and filtering of recordings based on various criteria. The ability to scale vertically and horizontally makes it a suitable choice for handling increasing data volumes and user traffic."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services that can be used to host and manage the entire application. AWS offers scalable compute resources (e.g., EC2, Lambda), managed database services (e.g., RDS for PostgreSQL), storage solutions (e.g., S3 for storing processed files or metadata), and networking services (e.g., VPC, API Gateway). AWS's security features, such as IAM and VPCs, help protect sensitive data. Its pay-as-you-go pricing model allows for cost-effective scaling of resources as needed. AWS Lambda can be used for serverless functions to process file uploads and interact with the NFS server."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "While the project scope seems relatively small initially, a microservices architecture provides flexibility and scalability for future enhancements. For example, a separate microservice could handle user authentication and authorization, another could manage file processing and interaction with the NFS server, and another could handle the API for the frontend. This approach allows for independent deployment and scaling of individual services, improving overall system resilience and maintainability. It also allows different teams to work on different parts of the application independently."
