    "summary": "This project aims to develop a portal/dashboard for VKYC leads (TL & Process Manager) to access V-KYC recordings for audit purposes. The system will allow searching recordings by LAN ID and bulk video download based on a list of LAN IDs uploaded via Excel or text file. The architecture will be based on microservices, using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and AWS for cloud hosting. JWT authentication and RBAC will be implemented for security. Docker, Git, and CI/CD pipelines will streamline the development and deployment process.",
