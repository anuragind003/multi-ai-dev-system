      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is well-suited for building interactive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture allows for modular and maintainable code. The project's requirements for search, filtering, and data display are easily implemented with React's capabilities. The availability of a large ecosystem of libraries and components will speed up development."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js offers a lightweight, efficient, and scalable backend solution. It allows for rapid development, especially when paired with a frontend built with React, as both can use JavaScript. Express.js provides a flexible framework for building APIs, handling file uploads, and interacting with the database. This stack is well-suited for the project's needs for API calls, file processing, and data retrieval."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that provides excellent data integrity and supports complex queries. It's a good choice for storing user data, recording metadata, and managing search indexes. Its support for JSON data types is also beneficial if the backend API returns data in JSON format. PostgreSQL's reliability and scalability make it a suitable choice for this project."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and deployment. Services like EC2 (for hosting the application), S3 (for storing recordings if needed), RDS (for PostgreSQL), and API Gateway (for API management) can be leveraged. AWS offers scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, making it an ideal platform for this project."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and independent deployments. For this project, separate microservices can be created for user authentication, data retrieval from the NFS server, file processing, and the API. This architecture allows for independent scaling of each service based on its load and facilitates easier maintenance and updates. It also aligns well with the project's goal of reducing dependency on IT by isolating the data retrieval functionality."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. It simplifies the process of packaging and deploying the application and its dependencies."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is essential for version control, allowing for collaborative development, tracking changes, and managing code revisions."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to set up the pipeline."
