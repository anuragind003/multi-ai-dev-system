    "tool_options": [],
    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "Although the BRD focuses solely on an API, a frontend framework is often implied for consuming such an API. React is chosen for its widespread adoption, robust ecosystem, component-based architecture, and excellent developer experience. It allows for rapid development of a user interface should one be required in a future phase, aligning with the 'ease of development' principle."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js is an optimal choice for a simple RESTful API due to its lightweight nature, high performance for I/O-bound operations (typical of CRUD APIs), and rapid development capabilities. It aligns perfectly with the non-functional requirement to 'prioritize ease of development and deployment for this initial version' and can easily handle 'up to 100 concurrent requests' with fast response times. The JavaScript ecosystem also allows for full-stack development consistency."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that provides strong data integrity (ACID compliance), robust features, and excellent performance for structured data. The product attributes (name, description, price, stock_quantity) are well-suited for a relational model. It ensures 'product data must be stored persistently' and offers reliability and scalability for future growth beyond the initial 'single server' constraint."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS is the leading cloud provider with a comprehensive suite of services that can easily host a Node.js API and PostgreSQL database. Services like EC2 for compute and RDS for managed PostgreSQL simplify deployment and management, contributing to the 'ease of deployment' requirement. AWS offers robust scalability options should the project grow, and its extensive documentation and community support are invaluable."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Monolithic Architecture",
      "reasoning": "For a 'simple CRUD API' with the explicit non-functional requirement to 'prioritize ease of development and deployment for this initial version' and the constraint that 'the API will be deployed on a single server', a Monolithic Architecture is the most pragmatic and efficient choice. It minimizes operational complexity, reduces overhead, and allows for rapid iteration and deployment, directly addressing the project's immediate needs without introducing unnecessary distributed system challenges."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Containerization with Docker ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments, simplifying deployment and dependency management for the Node.js application and potentially the database."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is the industry standard for version control, essential for collaborative development, tracking changes, and managing code releases effectively."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)",
        "reasoning": "An automated CI/CD pipeline is crucial for 'ease of deployment' and maintaining 'fast API responses'. It automates testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and rapid, reliable releases."

Node.js with Express.js provides a lightweight, high-performance backend for rapid development and fast API responses. PostgreSQL ensures robust, persistent, and reliable storage for structured product data. A Monolithic Architecture is the most appropriate choice for the 'initial version' and 'single server' constraint, prioritizing 'ease of development and deployment' by minimizing complexity. AWS offers a scalable and reliable cloud platform for hosting. Docker, Git, and a CI/CD pipeline are essential tools to streamline development workflows, ensure consistency, and automate deployments.
