The choice of AWS services (ALB, ECS, RDS) ensures cloud-native deployment, high availability, and scalability. Standard security practices like JWT and TLS are incorporated to protect data. The inclusion of Redis for caching and Prometheus/Grafana/ELK for observability ensures the system is performant and maintainable from the outset. This combination of technologies provides a solid, well-understood foundation that can be efficiently developed and operated.",
    "data_flow": "User requests originate from a client (e.g., web browser, mobile app) and are routed through an AWS Application Load Balancer. The ALB forwards the request to an available instance of the Node.js Express.js backend service running on AWS ECS. The backend processes the request, interacting with Redis for caching (checking cache before querying the database, and updating cache after writes). For persistent data operations (CRUD), the backend communicates with the PostgreSQL database (AWS RDS). Database responses are returned to the backend, which then formats the data into a JSON response and sends it back to the client via the Load Balancer. All communication between components is secured with TLS, and API requests are authenticated using JWT."
