The backend API sends a 201 Created response back to the frontend, including the newly created task's data. 6.  **Display:** The React frontend receives the response and updates the task list, displaying the new task to the user.  For retrieving tasks, the process is similar, but the frontend sends a GET request to `/tasks`, and the backend retrieves the tasks from the database and returns them to the frontend."
