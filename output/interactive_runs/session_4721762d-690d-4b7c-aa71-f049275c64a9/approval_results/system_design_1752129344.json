The Backend API queries the PostgreSQL database for this metadata. When a user requests to download a specific recording, the Frontend sends a download request to the Backend API. The Backend API, after verifying user authorization, retrieves the actual recording file from the File Storage System (e.g., S3/NFS) and streams it back to the Frontend, which then initiates the download in the user's browser. All significant user actions, especially recording downloads, are logged by the Backend API into the PostgreSQL database's 'audit_logs' table."
