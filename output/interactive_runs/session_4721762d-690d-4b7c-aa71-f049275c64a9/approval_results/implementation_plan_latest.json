    "summary": "This project aims to develop a secure web portal for VKYC Team Leads and Process Managers to efficiently fetch and download V-KYC recordings for audit and internal requirements. The implementation plan follows a monolithic (layered) architecture using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Key features include user authentication and role-based access control, on-demand recording search and filtering by date, month, and LAN ID, individual recording downloads, and a robust bulk upload and download mechanism. The plan also incorporates essential non-functional aspects such as security (JWT, RBAC, TLS), logging (ELK Stack), monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), and automated CI/CD pipelines for reliable deployment on AWS. The project is broken down into granular work items covering infrastructure, database, backend API development, frontend UI/UX, and comprehensive testing and operational setup.",
