      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React's component-based architecture is ideal for building the dashboard interface with tabular data display and search functionality. Its virtual DOM allows for efficient updates when displaying search results and handling pagination. React's rich ecosystem and large community provide ample resources and libraries for implementing features like file upload and data handling. Furthermore, React is well-suited for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface for the target audience."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "While the non-functional requirements specify Java with Spring Boot, Node.js with Express.js offers several advantages for this project. It allows for full-stack JavaScript development, simplifying the development process and potentially reducing development time. Node.js is highly scalable and efficient for handling API requests, especially for processing file uploads and retrieving data from the NFS server. Express.js provides a robust framework for building RESTful APIs and managing routing. Given the relatively simple data processing requirements (searching and downloading files), Node.js is a viable and potentially faster alternative. It's important to discuss this deviation from the non-functional requirement with the stakeholders."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that provides excellent data integrity and ACID compliance. It's well-suited for storing metadata about the V-KYC recordings, such as LAN IDs, dates, and file paths. PostgreSQL's support for JSON data types can be useful for storing flexible metadata. Its scalability and reliability make it a good choice for handling the growing volume of V-KYC recordings. While a database might not be strictly necessary initially if only file metadata is stored on the NFS, it provides a scalable and manageable solution for the long term."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services that are well-suited for hosting the portal, backend API, and database. AWS offers scalable compute resources (e.g., EC2, Lambda), managed database services (e.g., RDS for PostgreSQL), and storage solutions (e.g., S3) that can be easily integrated. AWS also provides robust security features and monitoring tools to ensure the security and reliability of the system. Using AWS allows for easy scaling of resources as the volume of V-KYC recordings grows. Furthermore, AWS offers services like API Gateway for managing API endpoints and CloudFront for content delivery, enhancing performance and security."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "While the project scope is relatively small, a microservices architecture offers several benefits. It allows for independent development and deployment of different components, such as the frontend, backend API, and file processing service. This improves maintainability and scalability. For example, the file processing service responsible for handling bulk downloads can be scaled independently based on demand. Microservices also promote code reusability and allow for easier integration with other systems in the future. In this case, the microservices could be: API Gateway, Authentication Service, Recording Metadata Service, and File Processing Service."
