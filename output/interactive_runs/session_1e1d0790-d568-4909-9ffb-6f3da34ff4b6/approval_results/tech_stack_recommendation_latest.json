      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React offers a component-based architecture, making it ideal for building interactive user interfaces. Its large ecosystem and readily available libraries will accelerate development. It's well-suited for handling the data display, filtering, and download functionalities described in the requirements."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js, with Express.js, provides a lightweight, efficient, and scalable backend solution. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling file uploads, API calls, and concurrent download requests. The use of JavaScript for both frontend and backend simplifies development and maintenance."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that offers excellent data integrity and support for complex queries. It's a good choice for storing metadata related to the recordings (e.g., LAN ID, date, file path) and user authentication data. Its reliability and scalability are suitable for this project."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and deployment. Services like EC2 (for hosting the application), S3 (for storing the recordings if needed, or metadata), and RDS (for PostgreSQL) offer scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS also provides robust security features and a global infrastructure."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different functionalities. This is beneficial for this project because it allows for separate services for user authentication, file upload processing, recording retrieval, and the frontend. This architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and resilience."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. It simplifies the process of packaging and deploying the application and its dependencies."

        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. Tools like GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline can be used."
      }
    ],
    "design_justification": "This technology stack is chosen to provide a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly solution. React provides a modern frontend experience, while Node.js with Express.js offers a performant backend. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and reliability. AWS provides a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure. The microservices architecture allows for independent scaling and easier maintenance. Docker, Git, and CI/CD pipelines streamline the development and deployment processes."
