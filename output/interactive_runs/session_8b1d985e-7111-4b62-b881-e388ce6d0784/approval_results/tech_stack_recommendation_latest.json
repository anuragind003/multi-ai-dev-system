    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is an excellent choice for building interactive and responsive user interfaces, which is crucial for a dashboard/portal. Its component-based architecture facilitates modular development, making it easy to create reusable UI elements for search filters, tabular data displays, file upload forms, and download buttons. The vast ecosystem, strong community support, and availability of mature UI libraries (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design) will accelerate development and ensure a high-quality user experience for VKYC Team Leads and Process Managers. Given the need for dynamic data display and user interaction (search, pagination, bulk uploads), React's declarative approach and efficient DOM updates are highly beneficial."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js is well-suited for the backend given the project's I/O-bound nature, involving file uploads, orchestrating calls to an existing backend API (likely for NFS interaction), and serving video recordings. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture allows it to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, which is important for bulk upload processing and concurrent downloads. The ability to use JavaScript/TypeScript across the full stack can streamline development, reduce context switching for developers, and simplify team management. Express.js provides a minimalist yet powerful framework for building RESTful APIs, handling file uploads, and managing authentication/authorization, aligning perfectly with the project's functional requirements."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that provides strong ACID compliance, ensuring data integrity for critical metadata like LAN IDs, recording dates, and user access information. Its advanced indexing capabilities and powerful query language (SQL) are ideal for efficient searching and retrieval of recordings by date, month, year, and LAN ID, as required by the BRD. PostgreSQL's reliability, scalability, and rich feature set (e.g., JSONB for flexible schema, if needed for future extensions) make it a highly dependable choice for storing structured data and managing user roles for restricted access."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that provide the scalability, security, and reliability required for this project. Key services like Amazon S3 can be used for highly durable and scalable storage of VKYC recordings (if they are to be copied from NFS for better portal performance or temporary storage during bulk downloads), or for managing temporary files during bulk uploads. AWS EC2 or ECS can host the Node.js backend and React frontend, while Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL provides a managed database service. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is crucial for implementing the restricted access requirements, and services like AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail will provide essential monitoring and auditing capabilities, addressing the security and performance risks identified in the BRD."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "A Microservices Architecture is recommended due to the distinct functional areas of the project: user authentication/authorization, recording metadata management, file upload processing, bulk request handling, and actual file serving/download. This pattern allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each service. For instance, the bulk processing service could be scaled independently of the user interface service. This modularity enhances resilience, as a failure in one service (e.g., bulk processing) does not necessarily impact others. It also provides flexibility for future integrations or changes to the underlying NFS interaction, mitigating the 'dependency on backend API' risk and supporting potential scalability challenges mentioned in the BRD."

PostgreSQL provides a reliable and performant database for managing recording metadata and user access. The Microservices architecture allows for independent development and scaling of distinct functionalities (e.g., user management, bulk processing, file serving), enhancing resilience and maintainability, and addressing potential future scalability needs. AWS provides the necessary cloud infrastructure for secure, scalable deployment, with services like S3 for storage, RDS for managed database, and IAM for strict access control. Essential tools like Docker and a CI/CD pipeline ensure consistent, automated, and reliable deployments, mitigating development and operational risks. This integrated stack is well-suited to meet the current functional requirements while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and addressing the non-functional considerations implicitly required for an internal enterprise application handling sensitive data.",
