PostgreSQL provides a reliable and feature-rich relational database for structured metadata. Leveraging AWS services (S3, RDS, EKS, ALB) ensures high availability, scalability, and security, while offloading infrastructure management. The design prioritizes security with JWT and RBAC, and auditability with a dedicated audit log service, directly addressing the project's core requirement for independent access and compliance.",

Upon login, the Frontend sends credentials to the API Gateway, which routes to the User Management Service. This service authenticates the user against PostgreSQL and issues a JWT. The Frontend stores this JWT and includes it in subsequent requests. When the user searches for recordings, the Frontend sends a request with the JWT to the API Gateway, which routes it to the VKYC Recording Metadata Service. This service queries PostgreSQL for recording metadata and returns it to the Frontend. If the user wishes to download a recording, the Frontend requests a pre-signed S3 URL from the API Gateway, which routes to the VKYC Recording Storage Service. This service generates a time-limited, secure URL for the specific recording from AWS S3 and returns it to the Frontend. The Frontend then uses this URL to directly download the recording from S3. All significant user actions (login, search, download) are captured by the respective services and sent to the Audit Log Service, which stores them in PostgreSQL, ensuring a comprehensive audit trail."
