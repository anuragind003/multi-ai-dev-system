Search results are returned to the frontend. 6. User requests a download for a specific video. 7. The backend verifies permissions, logs the request in the 'audit_logs' table, and generates a secure, time-limited pre-signed URL from the S3-compatible object storage. 8. The backend returns this URL to the frontend, which initiates a direct download from the object storage to the user's browser."
