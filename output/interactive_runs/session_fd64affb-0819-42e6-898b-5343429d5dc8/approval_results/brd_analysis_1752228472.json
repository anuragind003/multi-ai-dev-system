    "project_name": "V-KYC recordings to be fetched for Audit requirements",
    "project_summary": "To develop a self-service portal/dashboard for the V-KYC team leads to search, access, and download V-KYC video recordings directly. This will replace the current manual process of requesting files from the IT data server team, thereby streamlining the process for audit requirements.",
    "project_goals": [
      "To create a portal for the V-KYC team to fetch video recordings independently.",
      "To eliminate the dependency on the IT data server team for retrieving recordings.",
      "To provide search and bulk download capabilities for V-KYC recordings based on LAN IDs."

This process is inefficient, especially when recordings are needed for internal or external audits. This project is a change request to create a self-service portal to improve efficiency and provide direct access to authorized personnel.",
