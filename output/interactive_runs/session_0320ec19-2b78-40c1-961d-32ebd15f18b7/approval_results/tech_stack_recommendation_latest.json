    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is well-suited for building interactive user interfaces, which is essential for this portal. Its component-based architecture allows for modular and maintainable code. The project requires search, filtering, and bulk download functionalities, all of which can be efficiently implemented with React's capabilities. React's large community and readily available libraries will speed up development."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js provides a lightweight and efficient backend solution. Node.js is non-blocking and event-driven, making it suitable for handling concurrent requests, which is crucial for managing file uploads and downloads. Express.js simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, which are needed for communication with the frontend and the NFS server. The project's requirements, such as file processing and API calls, can be easily handled with Node.js and Express.js."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust and reliable relational database. It's well-suited for storing metadata about the recordings, such as LAN IDs, dates, and file paths. PostgreSQL's support for complex queries and indexing will enable efficient searching and filtering of recordings. It is a good choice for this project because it is open-source, scalable, and supports ACID properties, ensuring data integrity."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that can be leveraged for this project. Services like EC2 for hosting the application, S3 for storing the recordings (if not directly on the NFS), RDS for PostgreSQL, and API Gateway for managing the API endpoints provide a scalable and reliable infrastructure. AWS also provides robust security features and monitoring tools, which are essential for a production environment. AWS is a mature and widely adopted platform, offering a wide range of services that can be used to build, deploy, and manage the application."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different functionalities. This is beneficial because the project can be broken down into smaller, manageable services, such as a service for user authentication, a service for handling file uploads and downloads, and a service for interacting with the NFS server. This architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and fault isolation. It also allows for independent technology choices for each service, although in this case, the stack is consistent across the services for simplicity."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization of the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. This simplifies the deployment process and improves portability."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is essential for version control, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if needed."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline can be used to implement the pipeline."

React provides a robust frontend framework for building the user interface. Node.js with Express.js offers a lightweight and efficient backend for handling API requests and file processing. PostgreSQL ensures reliable data storage and efficient querying. AWS provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure for hosting the application and managing the resources. The microservices architecture allows for independent scaling and deployment of different components. The chosen tools streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow."
