    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is well-suited for building interactive user interfaces, offering a component-based architecture, and a large ecosystem of libraries for handling file uploads, data tables, and pagination. It provides a good developer experience and is efficient for single-page applications like this portal."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js is a good choice because it allows for rapid development of APIs. It's lightweight, efficient, and can handle file processing and interactions with the NFS server. JavaScript is also a good choice for full-stack development, as it can be used on both the frontend and backend."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust and reliable relational database that can efficiently store metadata about the recordings, such as LAN IDs, file paths, and download statuses. It offers strong data integrity and supports complex queries, which is beneficial for searching and filtering recordings."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and compute, making it ideal for deploying and managing this portal. Services like EC2, S3, and API Gateway can be used to host the application, store recordings, and manage API access. AWS also offers robust security features and scalability options."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent scaling and deployment of different parts of the application. For this project, separate microservices can handle file uploads, API interactions with the NFS server, and data storage/retrieval. This improves maintainability, scalability, and fault isolation."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization of the application, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. It simplifies dependency management and makes it easier to scale the application."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is essential for version control, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if needed."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. Tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions can be used to implement the pipeline."

      "frontend": {
        "language": "JavaScript/TypeScript",
        "framework": "React",
        "reasoning": "React provides a component-based architecture, making it easy to build and maintain the user interface. TypeScript can be used for type safety and improved code maintainability."

React provides a responsive and user-friendly frontend, while Node.js with Express.js handles the backend logic efficiently. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and efficient querying. AWS offers a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure. The microservices architecture allows for independent scaling and deployment of different components. Docker, Git, and CI/CD pipelines streamline development and deployment processes.",
