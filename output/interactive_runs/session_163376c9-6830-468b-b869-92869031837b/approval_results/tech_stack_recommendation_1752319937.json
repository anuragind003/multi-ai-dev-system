      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and compute. Services like EC2 (for backend), S3 (for storing recordings if needed), and RDS (for PostgreSQL) can be used. AWS also offers robust security features, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, making it a good choice for this project."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different functionalities. For this project, separate microservices can be created for user authentication, file retrieval, and data processing. This enhances maintainability, scalability, and resilience, especially as the project grows."

        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. Tools like GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline can be used."
      }
    ],
    "design_justification": "This stack provides a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution. React provides a great user experience for the dashboard. Node.js with Express.js allows for efficient backend development. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity. AWS provides a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure. The microservices architecture promotes modularity and independent scaling. The chosen tools streamline development and deployment."
