The File Processing Service validates and parses the file, extracting LAN IDs. 6. The File Processing Service calls the Recording Service, passing the LAN IDs. 7. The Recording Service retrieves recording metadata from the LTF AWS server. 8. The Recording Service stores recording metadata in the PostgreSQL database. 9. The Recording Service returns the recording details to the File Processing Service. 10. The File Processing Service returns the results to the API Gateway. 11. The API Gateway returns the results to the React frontend for display. 12. User can then download recordings via the frontend, which triggers a download request to the API Gateway. 13. The API Gateway calls the Recording Service to retrieve the recordings from AWS S3 and zips them. 14. The API Gateway streams the zip file to the user."
