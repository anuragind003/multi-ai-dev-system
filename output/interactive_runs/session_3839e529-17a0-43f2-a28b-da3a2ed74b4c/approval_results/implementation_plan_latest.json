    "summary": "Develop a portal/dashboard for V-KYC team leads to access and download V-KYC recordings for audit purposes. The system will allow users to search recordings by LAN ID and date/month, download individual recordings, and perform bulk downloads via file upload. The backend will be built with Node.js and Express, using PostgreSQL for the database and AWS S3 for file storage. The frontend will be built with React. The application will be deployed on AWS and will include automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.",
