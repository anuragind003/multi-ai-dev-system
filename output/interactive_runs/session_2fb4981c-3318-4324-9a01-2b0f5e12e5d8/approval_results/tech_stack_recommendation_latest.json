      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is well-suited for building interactive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability. The project's requirements for search, display of recording details, and bulk download functionality will benefit from React's ability to handle dynamic content and user interactions efficiently. The large ecosystem and readily available component libraries will accelerate development."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js provides a lightweight and efficient backend solution. It allows for rapid development and is well-suited for building APIs to handle requests for recordings. The non-blocking, event-driven architecture of Node.js makes it suitable for handling concurrent requests, which is important for this application. JavaScript's full-stack capabilities streamline development."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust and reliable relational database that can efficiently store and manage metadata about the recordings (e.g., LAN ID, date, file paths). It offers strong data integrity and supports complex queries, which are necessary for searching and filtering recordings. Its scalability and support for various data types make it a good fit for this project."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and compute. Services like S3 for storing recordings, EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk for hosting the application, and RDS for PostgreSQL offer scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS also provides robust security features and a wide range of tools for monitoring and managing the application."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different functionalities. For this project, separate microservices can be created for user authentication, recording retrieval, bulk download processing, and the frontend. This architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and fault isolation. It also allows for independent technology choices for each service if needed in the future."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization of the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. This simplifies the deployment process and improves portability."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is essential for version control, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if necessary."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to implement the pipeline."
