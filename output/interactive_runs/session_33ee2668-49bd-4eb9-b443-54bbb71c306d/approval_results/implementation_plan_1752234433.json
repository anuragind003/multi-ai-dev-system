    "summary": "This project plan outlines the development of a V-KYC recording portal. The work is broken down into five main phases: initial setup and database schema definition, backend API development (including authentication, search, and download logic), frontend UI development (login, dashboard, search/results components), CI/CD and containerization setup, and final deployment. The plan follows a logical progression, building foundational backend services first, followed by the frontend components that consume them, ensuring a smooth and dependency-aware development process. Each work item is granular, with clear acceptance criteria, designed to be picked up by a developer with minimal ambiguity.",
