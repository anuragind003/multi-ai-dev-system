The user submits a search query from the React UI. 5. The backend API receives the query, validates the JWT, and queries the PostgreSQL database for matching video metadata. 6. The search results are returned to the frontend and displayed. 7. The user clicks a 'download' button. 8. The backend generates a secure, pre-signed, time-limited URL pointing to the video file in the Secure Video Storage and logs the download request in the audit_logs table. 9. The frontend uses this URL to initiate a direct download from the storage to the user's browser."
