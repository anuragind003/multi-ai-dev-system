    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js provides a lightweight and efficient backend for handling API requests, file retrieval, and bulk download processing. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling concurrent requests, and its JavaScript-based nature allows for full-stack development with a single language."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that offers excellent data integrity, support for complex queries, and scalability. It's a good choice for storing metadata about the recordings, user information, and audit logs, ensuring data consistency and reliability."

      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and compute, making it an ideal platform for deploying this application. Services like EC2, S3, and RDS can be used for hosting the backend, storing recordings, and managing the database, respectively. AWS also offers robust security features and scalability options."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different parts of the application. This is beneficial because it allows for independent scaling of the frontend, backend, and any services related to file retrieval or bulk download processing. This architecture also improves maintainability and fault isolation."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization of the application, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments and simplifying the deployment process."

        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases."
      }
    ],
    "design_justification": "This technology stack provides a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution for the V-KYC recording portal. React provides a responsive user interface, Node.js with Express.js handles backend logic efficiently, PostgreSQL ensures data integrity, and AWS offers a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure. The microservices architecture allows for independent scaling and deployment of different components, and the use of Docker, Git, and CI/CD pipelines streamlines the development and deployment processes. This stack is well-suited for the project's requirements, including user authentication, search functionality, bulk download, and integration with existing infrastructure."
