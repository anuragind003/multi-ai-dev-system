        "reasoning": "Node.js is chosen for its excellent performance in I/O-bound operations, which are critical for handling file uploads, processing bulk requests, and serving recordings from the NFS server. The unified JavaScript/TypeScript stack with the frontend simplifies development and maintenance. NestJS provides a structured, enterprise-grade framework, while Express offers flexibility for simpler APIs."

        "framework": "React",
        "reasoning": "React is selected for its component-based architecture, which facilitates building a highly interactive and modular dashboard. Its strong community support, extensive ecosystem, and proven track record in creating dynamic user interfaces make it ideal for the search, filter, tabular display, and bulk download features required by the VKYC portal."

        "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is recommended for its robustness, ACID compliance, and rich feature set. It will serve as the reliable data store for all structured metadata related to V-KYC recordings (e.g., LAN IDs, dates, file paths, approval status) and user management (access control). Its advanced indexing capabilities will ensure efficient search and filtering."

Services like EC2 for compute, RDS for managed PostgreSQL, and IAM for robust access control align perfectly with the project's needs. While the NFS server is external, AWS offers various networking options to securely connect to on-premise resources if needed, or to host a proxy for the NFS server."
