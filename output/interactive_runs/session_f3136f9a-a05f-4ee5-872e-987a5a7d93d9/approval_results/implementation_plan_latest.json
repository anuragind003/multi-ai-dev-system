    "summary": "The project aims to develop a self-service portal for the VKYC team to independently fetch V-KYC recordings for audit and internal requirements. This will eliminate the current manual request process to the IT data server team. The solution will be built using a Layered (N-Tier) Architecture, with React for the frontend, Node.js (NestJS/Express) for the backend API, PostgreSQL for structured data, and S3-compatible object storage for the recordings. The deployment will leverage AWS services, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Key features include user authentication and RBAC, search and filter capabilities for recordings by date and LAN ID, single recording download, and bulk recording retrieval via file upload with a 'Download All' option. Comprehensive audit logging will be implemented for all access and download activities.",

Key risks include data security (mitigated by strong auth/auth, encryption), performance for bulk operations (mitigated by async processing, load testing), and integration with existing systems (mitigated by early stakeholder involvement and clear API contracts). User adoption is also a consideration, addressed by focusing on intuitive UI/UX and training.",
