Frontend sends credentials to the Node.js Backend API via a POST request to `/api/auth/login`. 2. **Authentication**: Backend authenticates the user against the `users` table in PostgreSQL. If successful, it generates a JWT and sends it back to the Frontend. 3. **Browse Recordings**: Frontend stores the JWT and uses it for subsequent authenticated requests. User navigates to the recordings dashboard. Frontend sends a GET request to `/api/recordings` (with JWT in header) to the Backend. 4. **Metadata Retrieval**: Backend validates the JWT, queries the `vkyc_recordings` table in PostgreSQL based on search/filter criteria, and returns the recording metadata to the Frontend. 5. **Display & Search**: Frontend displays the list of recordings. User can search/filter, triggering new requests to the Backend. 6. **Download Request**: User selects a specific recording and clicks 'Download'. Frontend sends a GET request to `/api/recordings/{id}/download-url` (with JWT) to the Backend. 7. **Generate Signed URL**: Backend validates the JWT and user's authorization (RBAC). It then generates a time-limited, pre-signed URL for the specific recording file from the Object Storage. 8. **Direct Download**: Backend returns the pre-signed URL to the Frontend. Frontend then uses this URL to directly download the recording file from the Object Storage. 9. **Audit Logging**: Throughout this process, the Backend logs relevant actions (login, metadata view, download request) to the `audit_logs` table in PostgreSQL."
