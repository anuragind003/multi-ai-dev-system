    "summary": "This project involves developing a V-KYC recording portal using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and AWS for cloud hosting. The architecture follows a microservices pattern with separate services for authentication, V-KYC data retrieval, and audit logging. The portal will allow authorized users (Team Leaders) to search, view, and download V-KYC recordings based on LAN ID, with support for bulk downloads via file upload. Security is implemented using JWT authentication and RBAC authorization. The project will be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.",
