    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React's component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability, crucial for a dashboard application. Its virtual DOM enhances performance, and a large community provides ample support and libraries. React excels at handling dynamic data updates and user interactions, essential for features like searching, filtering, and displaying V-KYC recordings. TypeScript integration with React can improve code quality and maintainability."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js, with Express.js, offers a lightweight and scalable backend solution. Its non-blocking I/O model is well-suited for handling concurrent requests, especially important for processing file uploads and serving video recordings. JavaScript on both the frontend and backend simplifies development and reduces the learning curve. Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries for tasks like file processing, API development, and database interaction. Its ability to efficiently handle asynchronous operations is crucial for managing the bulk video download functionality."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that provides ACID compliance, ensuring data integrity. It supports advanced data types and indexing, enabling efficient querying and retrieval of V-KYC recordings based on LAN ID, date, and other criteria. PostgreSQL's scalability and reliability make it suitable for handling a growing volume of V-KYC data. Its support for JSON data types can be beneficial for storing metadata associated with the recordings."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that can address all the project's needs, including compute, storage, database, and networking. AWS S3 can be used for storing the V-KYC recordings, providing scalability and cost-effectiveness. AWS Lambda can be used for serverless functions to process file uploads and trigger video downloads. AWS IAM provides robust access control and security features, essential for restricting access to the portal to authorized users (Team Leaders). AWS also offers services for monitoring, logging, and alerting, ensuring the application's reliability and performance."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "A microservices architecture allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of different functionalities. This is beneficial for the V-KYC portal, as features like file upload processing, video retrieval, and user authentication can be implemented as separate services. This approach enhances maintainability, fault isolation, and scalability. Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its specific needs, optimizing resource utilization. It also allows for different technologies to be used for different services if needed, although in this case, consistency is preferred."
