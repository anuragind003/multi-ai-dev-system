The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete product entries. The functional requirements include creating, retrieving all, retrieving by ID, updating, and deleting products. Non-functional requirements include performance, scalability, simplicity, and data persistence. The document also includes assumptions such as no user authentication, basic error handling, and deployment on a single server. The quality assessment indicates high clarity and consistency, with a completeness score of 8.0. No gaps were identified."
