    "project_name": "V-KYC recordings to be fetched for Audit requirements",
    "project_summary": "This project aims to develop a self-service portal/dashboard for the VKYC team to easily fetch V-KYC recordings for audit and internal requirements. Currently, this process involves manual requests to the IT data server team. The new system will provide direct access to approved PL-VKYC case recordings, allowing search by date, month, year, and LAN ID, as well as supporting bulk download capabilities.",
    "project_goals": [
      "To provide a self-service portal for VKYC team leads and process managers to fetch V-KYC recordings.",
      "To eliminate the manual request process for VKYC recording retrieval from the IT data server team.",
      "To make VKYC recordings readily available and easily accessible for audit and internal requirements."

      "VKYC Team Leads",

    "business_context": "Currently, the VKYC team relies on manual requests to the IT data server team to retrieve VKYC recordings stored on the LTF 'NFS (Network File System)' server. This manual process is inefficient and time-consuming, particularly when responding to internal and external audit requirements. There is a critical need for a streamlined, self-service mechanism to access these recordings directly.",
