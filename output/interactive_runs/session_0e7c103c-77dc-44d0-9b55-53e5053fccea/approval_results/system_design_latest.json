      "data_flow": "1. User interacts with the React frontend (add/view tasks). 2. Frontend makes API calls to the AWS API Gateway. 3. API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate Lambda functions (Task Creation or Task Retrieval). 4. Lambda functions interact with the PostgreSQL database to store or retrieve task data. 5. Lambda functions return responses to the API Gateway. 6. API Gateway returns responses to the frontend. 7. Frontend updates the UI based on the API responses."
