    "summary": "This project aims to develop a self-service portal for VKYC Team Leads and Process Managers to access and download V-KYC recordings, replacing the current manual process. The implementation plan is broken down into granular work items covering infrastructure setup, backend API development (Node.js/NestJS), frontend UI development (React), database schema (PostgreSQL), and integration with S3-compatible storage for recordings. Key features include user authentication and authorization (RBAC), searching and filtering recordings by date, month, and LAN ID, single recording download, and a bulk download functionality via file upload (CSV/TXT) with a 10-record limit per download batch. The plan also incorporates robust security measures (JWT, TLS, encryption), comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), and centralized logging (ELK Stack) to ensure reliability and auditability. A critical dependency is the data ingestion strategy to move existing VKYC recordings from the LTF NFS server to the S3-compatible object storage and populate the metadata database.",
