    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React offers a component-based architecture, making it ideal for building interactive dashboards. Its virtual DOM and efficient updates provide a smooth user experience. The large ecosystem and readily available UI component libraries (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) accelerate development. It's well-suited for the dynamic data display and user interactions required by the portal."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js, with Express.js, provides a lightweight, scalable, and efficient backend solution. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling concurrent requests, such as those from multiple users downloading recordings. JavaScript's full-stack capabilities streamline development, allowing frontend and backend developers to use the same language. Express.js simplifies API creation and routing."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that offers excellent data integrity, ACID compliance, and support for complex queries. It's a reliable choice for storing user data, recording metadata (e.g., LAN ID, date, duration), and managing user access. Its scalability and performance make it suitable for handling potentially large volumes of recording metadata."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and compute, making it an ideal platform for this project. Services like EC2 (for hosting the application), S3 (for storing recordings if needed), RDS (for PostgreSQL), and CloudFront (for content delivery) offer scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS also provides robust security features and compliance certifications."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different functionalities. For this project, it enables separation of concerns, such as a service for user authentication, a service for searching recordings, and a service for downloading recordings. This improves maintainability, scalability, and resilience. It also allows for independent technology choices for each service if needed in the future. For example, the download service could be optimized separately."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Docker enables containerization of the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. This simplifies the deployment process and improves portability."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is essential for version control, enabling collaboration, tracking changes, and reverting to previous versions of the codebase."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of errors. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to implement the pipeline."
