    "summary": "Develop a web portal for V-KYC team leads to access and download V-KYC recordings for audit purposes. The portal will allow users to search for recordings by LAN ID and date/month, upload a file for bulk download, and download individual recordings. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js, with PostgreSQL for the database and AWS S3 for file storage. The frontend will be built using React. The system will be deployed on AWS using a microservices architecture.",
