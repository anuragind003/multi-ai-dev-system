      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is an excellent choice for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces, which is crucial for the V-KYC portal/dashboard. Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability, making it efficient to develop features like search filters, tabular displays with pagination, and file upload interfaces. The large ecosystem and community support ensure access to a wide range of libraries for common UI patterns, accelerating development and providing robust solutions for the specified requirements like displaying paginated results and handling bulk request outputs."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js, coupled with Express.js, is highly suitable for this project due to its asynchronous, event-driven nature, which is efficient for I/O-bound operations. This is particularly beneficial for interacting with the existing LTF 'NFS(Network File System)' server to fetch recordings, calling external backend APIs for bulk processing, and handling file uploads. The ability to use JavaScript across the full stack (frontend and backend) can streamline development, reduce context switching for the team, and potentially accelerate time-to-market. Express.js provides a minimalist and flexible framework for building robust APIs required for search, bulk request processing, and file serving."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, data integrity (ACID compliance), and extensive feature set. For this project, it's ideal for storing structured data such as user authentication details (VKYC Team Leads, Process Managers), metadata about V-KYC recordings (e.g., LAN IDs, dates, approval status), and audit logs of user activities and bulk requests. Its advanced indexing capabilities will support efficient searching by date, month, year, and LAN ID. While recordings are on NFS, PostgreSQL will manage the pointers and associated metadata, ensuring robust data management for the portal's operational needs."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that can securely and reliably host the V-KYC portal. Its robust networking capabilities (e.g., VPN, Direct Connect) are critical for establishing secure and efficient connectivity to the existing on-premise LTF 'NFS(Network File System)' server, which is a core constraint. AWS provides scalable compute options (EC2, Lambda for specific tasks), secure storage (S3 for temporary file handling), identity and access management (IAM) for restricted portal access, and monitoring tools (CloudWatch). This makes AWS well-suited for a hybrid cloud scenario and provides the necessary enterprise-grade security and scalability for audit-related data."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "A Microservices Architecture is recommended to manage the complexity of integrating with existing systems (NFS, other backend APIs) and to ensure scalability and maintainability. This pattern allows for breaking down the application into smaller, independently deployable services (e.g., a user management service, a search service, a bulk processing service, an NFS integration service). This modularity helps in isolating failures, scaling specific components based on demand (e.g., the bulk processing service), and facilitating independent development and deployment cycles. It aligns well with the requirement to 'trigger a call to a backend API to process the bulk request,' suggesting a distributed processing model."

React on the frontend ensures a modern and intuitive user experience, capable of handling complex data displays and interactions. Node.js with Express.js on the backend offers high performance for I/O operations, which is critical for fetching recordings from the NFS server and processing bulk requests efficiently. PostgreSQL provides a reliable and feature-rich database for managing all structured data and metadata. AWS is selected as the cloud platform for its comprehensive services, strong security features, and excellent capabilities for hybrid cloud integration with the existing on-premise NFS. The Microservices Architecture allows for modular development, independent scaling of components (e.g., bulk processing), and better management of integrations with external systems. Essential tools like Docker, Git, and a CI/CD pipeline ensure consistent development environments, version control, and automated, reliable deployments. This integrated approach addresses the core functional requirements while laying a solid foundation for addressing non-functional aspects like security, performance, and future scalability, which were identified as key considerations in the BRD analysis.",
