The VKYC Recording Service queries PostgreSQL for metadata and, upon request, generates a pre-signed URL for direct download of the recording from AWS S3. All significant user actions and system events are logged by the respective services to the Audit Log Service, which persists them in PostgreSQL. Actual VKYC recording files are stored directly in AWS S3, with only their metadata residing in PostgreSQL."
