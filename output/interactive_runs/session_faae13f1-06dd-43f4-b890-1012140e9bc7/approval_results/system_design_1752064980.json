The choice of a Monolithic architecture with a React/FastAPI/PostgreSQL stack is cost-effective and allows for rapid development, which is suitable for the project's limited scope. The design explicitly incorporates solutions for the gaps identified in the BRD analysis, such as a dedicated audit log table, a clear error handling strategy, and robust security measures (RBAC, JWT). By containerizing the application and defining a clear deployment and monitoring strategy, the design ensures maintainability and reliability, meeting all stated requirements and success criteria.",
    "data_flow": "1. An authorized user (VKYC Team Lead) navigates to the web portal and is presented with a login screen. 2. The user enters their credentials into the React Frontend, which sends them to the FastAPI Backend's `/auth/token` endpoint. 3. The Backend validates the credentials against the `users` table in the PostgreSQL database and returns a JWT. 4. The Frontend stores this JWT and includes it in the `Authorization` header of all subsequent requests. 5. The user initiates a search, either by entering a single LAN or by uploading a CSV/TXT file for a bulk search. 6. The Frontend sends the request to the appropriate Backend API endpoint (`/recordings` or `/recordings/bulk-search`). 7. The Backend validates the JWT, authorizes the user's role, and queries the `recordings` table in PostgreSQL to find metadata matching the requested LAN(s). 8. The Backend logs this search action in the `audit_logs` table. 9. A paginated list of found recordings is returned to the Frontend and displayed in a table. 10. The user clicks a download link for a single recording. 11. The Frontend calls the `/recordings/download/{lan_number}` endpoint. 12. The Backend validates the request, retrieves the file path from the `recordings` table, reads the corresponding video file from the mounted NFS share, and streams the file content back to the user's browser, triggering a download. 13. The download action is logged in the `audit_logs` table."
