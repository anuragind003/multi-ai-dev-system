Key features include user authentication (JWT, RBAC), searching and filtering recordings by date/LAN ID, single recording download, and bulk recording download via file upload. The system will leverage PostgreSQL for metadata storage, interact with an existing NFS server for recordings, and be deployed on AWS with Docker and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring a robust, secure, and maintainable solution.",
