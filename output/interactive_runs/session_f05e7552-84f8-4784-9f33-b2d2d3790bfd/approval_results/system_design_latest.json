It allows for clear separation of concerns (presentation, business logic, data access) within a single codebase, which is manageable for a dedicated team portal. This approach minimizes overhead and allows for rapid iteration, while still providing a structured foundation that can be refactored or scaled horizontally if future needs dictate."

Upon login, the Frontend sends credentials to the Backend API (Node.js), which authenticates against the PostgreSQL database and returns a JWT token. This token is then used for all subsequent API requests. When a user requests a list of V-KYC recordings, the Frontend sends a request to the Backend API. The Backend queries the PostgreSQL database for recording metadata, applies any filters, and returns the results to the Frontend for display. If a user wishes to view or download a specific recording, the Frontend sends a request to the Backend API with the recording ID. The Backend retrieves the file path from PostgreSQL, then securely accesses the V-KYC Recording File Storage (e.g., S3) to either stream the file or generate a temporary signed URL, which is then provided to the Frontend to initiate the download. All significant user actions (login, viewing, downloading) are logged by the Backend into the PostgreSQL audit_logs table."
