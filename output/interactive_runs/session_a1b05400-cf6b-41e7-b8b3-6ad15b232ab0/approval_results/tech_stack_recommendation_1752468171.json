      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React is an excellent choice for building interactive user interfaces, which is crucial for the VKYC portal. Its component-based architecture facilitates modular development, making it easy to create reusable UI elements for search forms, tabular data displays, pagination, and file upload functionalities. The large and active community, extensive ecosystem of libraries (e.g., for data tables, file uploads), and strong performance characteristics will ensure efficient development and a smooth user experience for the VKYC team. Given the need for dynamic content display and user interaction (search, bulk upload, download), React's declarative nature and virtual DOM are highly beneficial."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js with Express.js is ideal for this project due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is highly efficient for I/O-bound operations like fetching and serving video files from the existing NFS server. This project involves file uploads, processing requests for video data, and serving large media files, all of which Node.js excels at. Express.js provides a minimalist and flexible framework for building robust APIs quickly. Furthermore, using JavaScript/TypeScript across both frontend and backend (full-stack JavaScript) can streamline development, improve team efficiency, and simplify code sharing and context switching for developers."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its robustness, reliability, and extensive feature set. For this project, it will be used to store critical metadata about VKYC recordings (e.g., LAN ID, date, month, file paths on NFS, status, user access logs) and user authentication data. Its strong ACID compliance ensures data integrity, which is paramount for audit requirements. PostgreSQL's advanced indexing capabilities will support efficient searching by date, month, and LAN ID, and its ability to handle structured data perfectly aligns with the project's data requirements. It also offers excellent security features and scalability for future needs."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS is the most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, offering a vast array of services that can fully support this project. For hosting, services like Amazon EC2 (for backend application) or AWS Lambda (for serverless functions, e.g., for file processing) combined with Amazon RDS (for PostgreSQL) provide a scalable and reliable infrastructure. AWS S3 can be used for temporary storage of uploaded files or processed batches. Crucially, AWS provides robust security features (IAM, VPC, Security Groups) essential for handling sensitive VKYC data and meeting audit requirements. Its mature ecosystem and extensive documentation will facilitate integration with the existing NFS server (e.g., via VPN or Direct Connect) and provide necessary monitoring and logging capabilities."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "While the initial scope might seem small, a Microservices Architecture is recommended to address the specific challenges and future potential of this project. The core functionality involves distinct concerns: user interface, API for metadata search/management, and a dedicated service for handling file uploads, processing LAN IDs, and serving video files from the NFS. Separating these into distinct microservices (e.g., a UI service, a Metadata API service, and a File Processing/Serving service) offers several advantages: independent deployment and scaling (especially crucial for the I/O-heavy video serving component), improved fault isolation, and better maintainability. This modularity allows for scaling the video fetching/serving part independently if performance becomes a bottleneck, without affecting the entire application. It also aligns with the 'backend API' mention in the requirements, promoting a clear separation of concerns."

      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Essential for version control, collaborative development, tracking changes, and managing code branches. A central Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, AWS CodeCommit) will be crucial for team collaboration."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline)",
        "reasoning": "Automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline to ensure code quality through automated testing, and to streamline the deployment process, enabling faster and more reliable releases. This reduces manual errors and speeds up delivery of new features."
