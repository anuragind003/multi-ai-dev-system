    "summary": "The project aims to create a secure and efficient V-KYC recordings portal, eliminating manual data requests. It will feature user authentication, search capabilities by date, month, and LAN ID, and both single and bulk download functionalities. The system is designed with a microservices architecture, leveraging React for the frontend, Node.js/Express.js for backend services, PostgreSQL for structured data, and AWS for scalable cloud infrastructure. Key services include User Management, Recording Metadata, Recording Storage, and Audit Logging, all orchestrated via an API Gateway. The implementation plan is broken down into granular work items covering infrastructure setup, database schema design, backend API development, frontend UI/UX, containerization, CI/CD, testing, security, and documentation. This structured approach ensures a robust, maintainable, and auditable solution.",
