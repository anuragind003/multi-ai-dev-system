      "justification": "Microservices architecture is chosen to decouple the system into smaller, independently deployable services. This allows for better scalability of individual components (e.g., user management vs. recording retrieval), improves fault isolation, enables independent development and deployment cycles, and provides flexibility in technology choices for specific services if needed. It aligns well with the need for distinct functionalities like user authentication, metadata management, and file serving."
