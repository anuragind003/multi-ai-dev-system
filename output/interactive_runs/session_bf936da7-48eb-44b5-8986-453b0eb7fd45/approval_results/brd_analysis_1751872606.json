The functional requirements include creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products. Non-functional requirements specify performance (200ms response time), scalability (100 concurrent requests), simplicity in the technology stack, and data persistence. The document also includes assumptions such as no user authentication, basic error handling, and deployment on a single server. The analysis did not identify any gaps."
