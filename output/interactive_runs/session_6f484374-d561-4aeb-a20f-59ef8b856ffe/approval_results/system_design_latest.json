The backend fetches the tasks from MongoDB and sends them back to the frontend. 6. **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the task data from the backend and displays it to the user.",

This request includes the task description. 3. **Backend Processing:** The backend API receives the request, validates the input, and then interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose to save the new task. 4. **Database Interaction:** MongoDB stores the task data. 5. **Backend Response:** The backend API sends a success response (201 Created) back to the frontend, including the newly created task's details.  For retrieving tasks, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend API. The backend fetches the tasks from MongoDB and sends them back to the frontend. 6. **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the task data from the backend and displays it to the user."

The tech stack is well-suited for this project's scope and complexity, allowing for a quick development cycle and easy deployment.",
      "data_flow": "1. **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the React frontend, adding tasks through a form or viewing the task list. 2. **Frontend to Backend:** When a user adds a task, the frontend sends a POST request to the backend API (Express). This request includes the task description. 3. **Backend Processing:** The backend API receives the request, validates the input, and then interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose to save the new task. 4. **Database Interaction:** MongoDB stores the task data. 5. **Backend Response:** The backend API sends a success response (201 Created) back to the frontend, including the newly created task's details.  For retrieving tasks, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend API. The backend fetches the tasks from MongoDB and sends them back to the frontend. 6. **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the task data from the backend and displays it to the user."
