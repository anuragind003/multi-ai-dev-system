    "frontend": {
      "name": "React",
      "reasoning": "React provides a component-based architecture, making it ideal for building interactive user interfaces. Its virtual DOM and efficient update mechanisms contribute to fast performance, crucial for a user-friendly experience. The large ecosystem and readily available libraries will accelerate development."
    },
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Node.js, with Express.js, offers a lightweight and efficient backend solution. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling concurrent requests, which is important for search and download operations. The use of JavaScript across the full stack simplifies development and maintenance."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "reasoning": "PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that offers excellent data integrity and supports complex queries. It's a good choice for storing metadata about the recordings (e.g., LAN IDs, dates, file paths). Its reliability and scalability are suitable for the project's needs."
    },
    "cloud": {
      "name": "AWS (Amazon Web Services)",
      "reasoning": "AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services for hosting, storage, and compute, making it a suitable choice for this project. Services like S3 for storing recordings, EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk for hosting the application, and RDS for the database offer scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness."
    },
    "architecture": {
      "name": "Microservices Architecture",
      "reasoning": "Microservices architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of different functionalities. This is beneficial as the project grows. For example, the bulk download functionality can be a separate service, allowing for independent scaling and easier maintenance. This architecture also promotes better fault isolation."
    },
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "Docker",
        "reasoning": "Containerization with Docker ensures consistent deployments across different environments, simplifying the deployment process and improving portability."
      },
      {
        "name": "Git",
        "reasoning": "Git is essential for version control, enabling collaboration, tracking changes, and managing code effectively."
      },
      {
        "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
        "reasoning": "A CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment, ensuring faster release cycles and reducing the risk of errors."
