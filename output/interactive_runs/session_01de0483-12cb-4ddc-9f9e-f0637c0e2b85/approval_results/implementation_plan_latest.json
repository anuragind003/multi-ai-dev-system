    "summary": "Develop a web portal for V-KYC team leads to access and download V-KYC recordings for audit purposes. The portal will provide user authentication, search functionality, date/month-wise filtering, bulk download via file upload, and individual recording downloads. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js, with PostgreSQL for the database and AWS S3 for storing recordings. The frontend will be built using React. The application will be deployed on AWS using a microservices architecture.",
