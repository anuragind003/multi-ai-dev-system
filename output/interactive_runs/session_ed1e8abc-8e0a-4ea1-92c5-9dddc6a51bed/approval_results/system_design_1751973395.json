This request includes the task description. 3.  **Backend Processing:** The backend API receives the request, validates the input, and then saves the task data to the MongoDB database. 4.  **Database Interaction:** The backend API interacts with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve task data. 5.  **Backend Response:** After successfully saving the task, the backend API sends a success response (e.g., 201 Created) back to the frontend, including the newly created task's details.  For retrieving tasks, the backend retrieves tasks from the database and sends them to the frontend. 6.  **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the response from the backend and updates the task list, displaying the new task to the user.",

For retrieving tasks, the backend retrieves tasks from the database and sends them to the frontend. 6.  **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the response from the backend and updates the task list, displaying the new task to the user."

This request includes the task description. 3.  **Backend Processing:** The backend API receives the request, validates the input, and then saves the task data to the MongoDB database. 4.  **Database Interaction:** The backend API interacts with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve task data. 5.  **Backend Response:** After successfully saving the task, the backend API sends a success response (e.g., 201 Created) back to the frontend, including the newly created task's details.  For retrieving tasks, the backend retrieves tasks from the database and sends them to the frontend. 6.  **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the response from the backend and updates the task list, displaying the new task to the user."
