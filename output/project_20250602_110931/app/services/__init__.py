"""
Initializes the 'services' package for the Simple Task Tracker application.

This package is designed to encapsulate the business logic and operations
related to the application's core functionalities, such as user authentication,
user management, and task management. It serves as an abstraction layer
between the application's controllers/views and the data access layer (models/database).

Future service modules (e.g., user_service.py, task_service.py) will reside
within this package. Key classes or functions from these modules may be
imported here to provide a cleaner import path (e.g., `from app.services import UserService`
instead of `from app.services.user_service import UserService`).

As of this initial setup, no specific service classes are exposed at the
package level, but this file ensures that 'services' is recognized as a
valid Python package.
