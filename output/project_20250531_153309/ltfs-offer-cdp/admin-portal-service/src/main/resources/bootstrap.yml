      enabled: true # Enables the Spring Cloud Config client.
      fail-fast: true # If true, the application will fail to start if it cannot connect to the Config Server. Recommended for production.
      # profile: dev # Optional: Specifies the profile to fetch from the Config Server. If not specified, 'default' is used.
      # label: main # Optional: Specifies the Git branch/label to fetch configuration from. If not specified, 'main' or 'master' is used.
eureka:
  client:

    fetch-registry: true # Indicates whether the Eureka client should fetch the registry from the Eureka server.
    register-with-eureka: true # Indicates whether the Eureka client should register itself with the Eureka server.
  instance:
    hostname: localhost # Hostname to register with Eureka. For local development, 'localhost' is common.
    preferIpAddress: true # If true, the IP address will be registered with Eureka instead of the hostname. Often preferred in containerized environments.
    instance-id: ${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}} # Unique ID for this instance, useful when running multiple instances of the same service.
