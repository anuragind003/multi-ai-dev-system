# EcoHaul - Backend & Frontend Implementation Progress

## âœ… What Has Been Completed

- **Backend (Node.js + Express + SQLite):**
  - User authentication (register, login, JWT, /me endpoint)
  - Product CRUD endpoints
  - Cart CRUD endpoints
  - Order/checkout endpoints
  - Order history endpoint
  - Passwords securely hashed (bcrypt)
  - JWT authentication middleware
  - User roles (admin/vendor)
  - Admin endpoints (manage users, products, orders)
  - Vendor endpoints (manage own products, view own orders)
  - User profile update (name, email, password)
  - Vendor registration/approval flow (pending_vendor, admin approval)
- **Frontend (React + Vite):**
  - Product list connected to backend
  - User authentication (login/register modal, JWT, auto-login)
  - Order checkout and order history (modals, backend integration)
  - Toast/Snackbar notifications for all key actions
  - Loading spinners for async actions (login, register, checkout, order history, product loading)
  - Modal accessibility (focus trap, ESC to close)
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Admin dashboard UI (view/manage users, products, orders; edit/delete/approve/reject vendor UI)
  - Vendor dashboard UI (view/manage own products, view own orders; edit/delete UI only)
  - Cart persistence (backend sync for logged-in users)
  - User profile/account modal (update name, email, password)
  - Vendor registration button and pending state
- **Project Structure:**
  - `/backend` for Node.js API
  - `/components` for reusable React components

## ðŸŸ¡ In Progress / To Do

- **UI Polish:**
  - Further accessibility improvements
  - More user-friendly error messages and edge case handling
- **Deployment:**
  - Prepare for deployment (env vars, persistent storage, etc.)

# EcoHaul Platform Documentation

## Overview
EcoHaul is a full-stack sustainable marketplace platform with:
- Modern React frontend (Vite, TypeScript, modular components)
- Secure Node.js/Express backend (JWT auth, SQLite, RESTful API)
- Role-based access (user, admin, vendor)
- Admin and vendor dashboards
- Cart, order, and profile management

## Features
- User registration, login, and profile management
- Product browsing and cart with backend sync
- Order checkout and order history
- Vendor registration and admin approval
- Admin dashboard for managing users, products, orders, and vendor approvals
- Vendor dashboard for managing own products and orders
- Toast notifications, loading spinners, and accessible modals

## Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Frontend: `npm install` (from project root)
2. **Start backend:**
   - `cd backend && node index.js`
3. **Start frontend:**
   - `npm run dev` (from project root)
4. **Environment:**
   - Backend runs on `http://localhost:3005` by default
   - Frontend expects backend at `http://localhost:3005`

## Usage
- Register as a user, login, and shop for products
- Add items to cart (cart is persistent for logged-in users)
- Checkout to place orders
- Apply to become a vendor (button in user menu)
- Admins can approve/reject vendor applications and manage all data
- Vendors can manage their own products and view their orders

## Customization & Deployment
- See code comments for extension points (e.g., add product images, categories, etc.)
- For deployment, set environment variables and use a persistent SQLite or migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL as needed
