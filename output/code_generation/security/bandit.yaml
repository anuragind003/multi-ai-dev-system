# Bandit configuration file
# For more details, see: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

# Exclude specific files or directories from scanning
exclude_dirs:
  - tests/
  - .venv/
  - venv/
  - .git/
  - .github/
  - docs/
  - prometheus/
  - grafana/
  - security/
  - __pycache__/

# Include only specific files (if exclude_dirs is not enough)
# include:
#   - app/*.py

# Severity levels for reporting
# HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNDEFINED
severity_level: medium
confidence_level: medium

# Specific checks to include or exclude
# BXXX refers to Bandit test IDs (e.g., B101 for assert_used)
# See: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/index.html
# Example:
# checks:
#   exclude:
#     - B101 # assert_used (often used in tests, can be ignored for app code)
#     - B603 # subprocess_without_shell_true (if you know what you're doing)

# You can also specify specific checks to include
# checks:
#   include:
#     - B104 # hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces
#     - B105 # hardcoded_password_string
#     - B106 # hardcoded_password_default_arg

# For this project, we'll keep it simple and rely on default checks
# with the specified severity and confidence levels.
