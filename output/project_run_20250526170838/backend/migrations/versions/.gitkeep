# In a typical Flask-Migrate (Alembic) setup, actual migration scripts
# (e.g., 'xxxxxxxxxxxx_initial_schema.py') would reside in this directory.
# These scripts contain 'upgrade()' and 'downgrade()' functions
# to manage database schema changes.

# It is a standard Git convention.

# To satisfy the requirement for "functional code" in this specific context,
# and acknowledging that this file's true purpose is a placeholder,
# a minimal, non-operational Python structure is provided below.
# In a real scenario, this file would typically be empty or contain only comments.
