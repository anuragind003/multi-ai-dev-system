"""
This file marks the 'scripts' directory as a Python package.
It can be left empty or contain package-level initialization code.
In this project, it primarily serves as a marker for utility scripts
that can be run independently or as scheduled tasks (e.g., data ingestion,
deduplication, data export to EDW).
