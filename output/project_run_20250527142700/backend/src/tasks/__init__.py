# This file marks the 'tasks' directory as a Python package.
# It can be left empty or used to import specific task functions
# to make them directly accessible when importing the 'tasks' package.
# For example:
# from .deduplication import run_deduplication_task
# from .exports import generate_moengage_file

# No Flask app initialization (create_app) or database connection setup here,
# as this file is for a sub-package within 'backend/src', not the main application entry point.
# These responsibilities belong to the top-level 'backend/src/__init__.py' or 'backend/app.py'.
