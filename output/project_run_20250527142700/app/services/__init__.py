# This file makes the 'services' directory a Python package.
# Individual service modules (e.g., ingestion_service.py, report_service.py)
# will be defined within this directory.
# No specific initialization logic is required here for the current project scope,
# as the main application setup (create_app) is handled in app.py or app/__init__.py.
# This file can be used to import and expose common service functions or classes
# from submodules if needed, but for now, it serves primarily as a package marker.
