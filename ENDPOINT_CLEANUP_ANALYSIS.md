  - Purpose: Real-time workflow events and human approval requests
  - Status: Required for core functionality

## Potentially Unused Endpoints (Consider for Removal)

### üî∂ Development/Testing Only

- **POST `/api/workflow/create`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è TESTING ONLY
  - Used by: `test_integration.py` only
  - Purpose: Create workflow session without starting
  - Recommendation: Keep for testing, but secure or remove from production

### üî∂ Administrative/Future Features (Keep but Secure)

- **GET `/api/agent-sessions`** - üí° FUTURE FEATURE

  - Purpose: List all active sessions
  - Recommendation: Keep for admin panel/session recovery features
  - Action: Add authentication/authorization

- **GET `/api/agent-sessions/{session_id}/history`** - üí° FUTURE FEATURE

  - Purpose: Get session execution history
  - Recommendation: Keep for debugging/audit features
  - Action: Add authentication/authorization

- **GET `/api/temperature-strategy`** - üí° FUTURE FEATURE

  - Purpose: Get current temperature strategy configuration
  - Recommendation: Keep for admin configuration features
  - Action: Add authentication/authorization

- **GET `/api/workflow/status/{session_id}`** - üí° FUTURE FEATURE
  - Purpose: Get detailed workflow status
  - Recommendation: Keep for enhanced monitoring
  - Action: Consider merging with results endpoint

### ÔøΩ Static HTML Interface (Keep but Document)

- **POST `/api/workflow-with-monitoring`** - üí° STATIC HTML INTERFACE

  - Used by: `app/static/agent_monitor.html`
  - Purpose: Alternative workflow endpoint with monitoring for static HTML interface
  - Recommendation: Keep for static monitoring interface, document differences from run_interactive

- **POST `/api/workflow/{session_id}/resume_enhanced`** - ‚ùå UNUSED

  - Purpose: Enhanced workflow resumption
  - Recommendation: Remove or merge with standard resume endpoint

- **GET `/api/workflow/results/{session_id}/{approval_type}`** - ‚ùå UNUSED

  - Purpose: Get specific approval type results
  - Recommendation: Remove or document when this would be used instead of general results

- **POST `/api/llm`** - ‚ùå LANGSERVE ROUTE
  - Purpose: LangServe LLM playground endpoint
  - Recommendation: Keep only in development, remove from production

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED - Removed completely unused endpoints:**

   - `/api/workflow/{session_id}/resume_enhanced` - Successfully removed
   - `/api/workflow/results/{session_id}/{approval_type}` - Successfully removed

2. **Secure administrative endpoints:**

   - Add authentication middleware to `/api/agent-sessions/*`
   - Add authentication middleware to `/api/temperature-strategy`

3. **Environment-specific endpoints:**
   - Remove `/api/llm` LangServe route from production
   - Keep `/api/workflow/create` for testing only

### Future Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Consolidate similar endpoints:**

   - Consider merging `/health` and `/api/health`
   - Evaluate if `/api/workflow/status/{session_id}` should replace or complement results endpoint

2. **Add API versioning:**

   - Prefix all API endpoints with `/api/v1/`
   - Implement version compatibility checks

3. **Enhanced security:**
   - Add rate limiting to all endpoints
   - Implement API key authentication for non-public endpoints
   - Add request/response validation middleware

### Documentation Improvements (Low Priority)

1. **OpenAPI documentation:**

   - Document all kept endpoints with proper schemas
   - Add examples for each endpoint

2. **Endpoint categorization:**
   - Group endpoints by functionality in documentation
   - Clear separation between public, authenticated, and development endpoints

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cleanup (1-2 hours)

- Remove confirmed unused endpoints
- Update any remaining references
- Test that removal doesn't break functionality

### Phase 2: Security (2-3 hours)

- Implement authentication for administrative endpoints
- Add environment-based endpoint filtering
- Test security measures

### Phase 3: Documentation (1 hour)

- Update API documentation
- Create endpoint usage guide
- Document security requirements

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**

- Removing endpoints with no references in codebase
- Adding authentication to administrative endpoints

**Medium Risk:**

- Removing LangServe route (verify not used by external integrations)
- Consolidating health check endpoints

**High Risk:**

- None identified - all changes are additive security or cleanup of unused code

## Notes

- All endpoint removals should be tested in development environment first
- Consider implementing endpoint deprecation warnings before removal
- Keep audit trail of removed endpoints for potential rollback
- Verify no external integrations depend on endpoints before removal
